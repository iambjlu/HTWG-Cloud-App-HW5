# HTWG-Cloud-App-HW5

We want to improve the application and use infrastructure as code to deploy the application to the cloud VM.
Create a load test which triggers scaling behaviour of your application. Test the Scenarios "Periodic Workload" and "Once-in-a-lifetime Workload".
Document the load balacing parameters, the test execution and the server load in a test protocol.

* Create terraform project for automated deployment
* Check terraform files into version control
* Create script to fill application with initial data
* Create load test scripts for the following scenarios
* Periodic workload
* Once-in-a-lifetime Workload
* Create test report summarizing your findings
